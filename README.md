## Description

_This application allows the user to request aid in the event of a natural or manmade disaster.  The application is meant to compliment the efforts of 911 responders, who may be overwhelmed with calls.  In the event of a disaster the user enters the relevant information pertaining to their location and medical or other needs. At a minimum the user must enter the street on which they are located. The user then sees a confirmation of their information.  This application also services pre-approved responders, by giving them a list of people in need of their services, complete with their current location and situation status.  The pre-approved responders may also update the users information status, by indicating that they as responders are either on the way to help, have helped, or can no longer help the user. Responders may also add individuals in need of aid to the user list._
